The ruler was placed in a leaning position against the wall with the widest face with no markings parallel to the wall and with the tip marked with 1 metre or 100cm closest to the ceiling. A ball was held next to the ruler with the top tip of the ball in line with the line marking the height that the ball was going to be dropped. The ball was released and the person who dropped it observed the marking the top tip of the ball was in line with. The data was noted in the table and the process was repeated for three trials. The entire method from holding the ball to writing the data was repeated for each of the four heights in the experiment. The results from every three trials were averaged and their averages were written in the table according to their respective trials. This was the end of the experiment.
